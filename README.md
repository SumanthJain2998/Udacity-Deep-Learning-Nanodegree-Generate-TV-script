# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Generate-TV-script
In this project, we'll generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
